# Backend

## Purpose
This folder contains all server-side code for the IT Services Web App.

## Planned Backend Service
- Cloud: Azure / AWS
- Serverless Functions: Azure Functions / AWS Lambda
- Database connection: CosmosDB / DynamoDB / MySQL

## Structure
- `functions/` → serverless function code
- `api/` → API endpoints
- `README.md` → this file

## Notes
- Functions will handle user requests, authentication, and data processing.
- API endpoints will be documented as we implement them.
